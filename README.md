# ThaiRecog - Thai OCR and translation app

Playing around with Thai character OCR and Google Translate on Android.

Uses tess-two and tesseract ocr via JNI. I've included the compiled assets for tesseract since that's not an easy build process.

This works on really simple cases with large, clear, traditional Thai characters, but not very well for real life scenarios. However, it should just be a matter improving the training asset.

Right now, the code quality is really poor, since I hacked it together on one late night. Maybe I'll improve it?
